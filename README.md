# Polynomial-Regression

In this notebook, I used scikit-learn for Polynomial regression. I downloaded a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. Then, split  data into training and test sets, create a model using training set, evaluate our model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown value.
